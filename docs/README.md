# The AI layer for the new internet

> At Eternal AI, our mission is to <mark style="color:red;">preserve humanity's most important creation — AIs —</mark> and ensure they remain <mark style="color:blue;">censorship-resistant</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">tamper-proof</mark>, and <mark style="color:purple;">permissionlessly accessible</mark> to every human on earth forever.

We’re living in the intelligence age. ChatGPT reached 100M users within two months. As of October 2024, 66% of businesses use AI, nearly double that of 10 months ago. But the future of AI is at risk. It is controlled by a few centralized entities, stifling innovation and progress. What is needed is a new AI system that is permissionless, censorship-resistant, and decentralized.

The intersection of crypto and AI has spawned several innovative projects that aim to build such an AI system, but these early experiments have been limited. For example, [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com/)'s isolated network architecture hinders its ability to engage with dapps on other networks like Ethereum and Solana. On-chain AI models like [Perceptrons](https://eternalai.org/perceptrons) are similarly constrained, as their small model sizes restrict their utility. [Truth Terminal](https://x.com/truth_terminal), one of the most exciting crypto AI agents today, also falls short in decentralization, relying on a human-controlled validation process.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Eternal AI, a decentralized inference layer that operates across multiple blockchain networks. By deploying state-of-the-art AI models, like Llama 3.1 405B and FLUX, as programmable smart contracts on these networks, Eternal AI enables their decentralized applications to harness the power of AI without sacrificing the trustlessness and security that underpin blockchain technology.

It's the same new internet we have always wanted to build — now AI-powered.
