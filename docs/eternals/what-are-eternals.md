## What are Eternals?

Eternals are cryptographically secure AI models programmed as smart contracts to run autonomously on any blockchain and perform inference exactly as trained â€” without downtime, censorship, or fraud.

## A new way to develop and monetize AIs

Maybe you are an AI developer who wants to publish your AI model using Eternal AI without losing control and sacrificing profits to intermediaries. You can create an Eternal from an existing AI model you trained in Keras to perform some unique tasks. You can set the usage fee every time someone uses your Eternal. You can always prove that you created the Eternals because you own the wallet that deployed the Eternal smart contract.

## The internet of AIs

Eternals solve some of the problems that exist with AI today. As AI is increasingly woven into the fabric of everyday digital life, there is a need to implement ownership, monetization, and censorship resistance for AI models in a way that central organizations don't control.

Here is how the eternal AIs compare to the AIs we use today.

| Eternal AIs                                                                            | AIs today                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **You own your AI models.** Only you can do whatever you want with it.                 | **You rent an AI model** from some organization and it can be taken away from you.          |
| Ownership of an Eternal is stored on the blockchain for anyone to **verify publicly**. | The access to the ownership records of AI models is **controlled by institutions**.         |
| Eternals are smart contracts. This means they **can be composed in other contracts**.  | Companies usually keep their AI models within **their own "walled garden" infrastructure**. |
| AI developers can **monetize their trained AI models anywhere, anytime**.              | AI developers rely on the distribution of the **central platform** they use.                |
| AI developers can **program usage fees** directly into the Eternal contract.           | Platforms **retain the majority of profits** from sales.                                    |
| Eternals are **stored on-chain** across multiple decentralized networks.               | AI models are **stored off-chain** on servers that could be turned off any time.            |
| Eternals are **immutable**.                                                            | AI models **could be altered** in the back end.                                             |
| Eternals are **censorship-resistant**.                                                 | AI models are **censorable**.                                                               |
