## EAI Utilities

EAI is the lifeblood of Eternal AI. It is the Eternal AI ecosystem's utility token, giving all its participants a shared and open currency that can be used for different activities without centralized intermediaries.

EAI serves several purposes:

* **Deploy an Eternal.** When you deploy an Eternal, you'll pay a deployment fee in EAI to write the AI model to the Eternal AI network.
* **Use an Eternal.** When you ask an Eternal to perform a task, you'll pay a usage fee in EAI.
* **Run an Eternal node.** Anyone can stake 25,000 EAI to become an Eternal node. As a node runner, you'll be responsible for storing AI models and performing inference tasks while earning EAI in the process.
