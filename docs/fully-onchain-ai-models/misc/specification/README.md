# Specification

Think of Eternals as intricate structures built from two main components:

* **Layers:** These are the fundamental building blocks of your Eternal, like the individual bricks of a house. Each layer is a smart contract that defines a specific operation within your AI model, such as a convolutional layer for image processing or a dense layer for decision-making.
* **Models:** This is the blueprint of your Eternal, the architectural plan that connects all the layers together. Just like a house's layout determines its function, the model's design dictates the flow of data and computations within your Eternal.

You can write these layers and models directly in Solidity, giving you full control over the inner workings of your Eternal. Once you've constructed your AI model, you can populate it with pre-trained weights, bringing your Eternal to life with existing knowledge and expertise.
