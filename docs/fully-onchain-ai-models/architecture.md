# Architecture

Eternal AI is a GPU-accelerated blockchain designed specifically for decentralized AI. It harnesses the specialized tensor cores on NVIDIA GPUs for high-performance tensor computations and accelerates AI/ML inference. It also leverages Bitcoin as a secure base layer.

Let's explore the major components of the Eternal AI blockchain.

## Eternals

Eternals are decentralized, onchain AIs that live forever on the blockchain. Written as smart contracts, they operate autonomously without human intervention and are not owned by one entity.

## Eternal AI Deep Learning Lib

Eternal AI Deep Learning Lib is a set of Solidity smart contracts that makes it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models on-chain.

## BVM BitGPU

Powered by BVM, Eternal AI runs on the BitGPU execution engine. BitGPU is a GPU-accelerated Bitcoin rollup framework explicitly designed for compute-intensive applications.

## GPU

Eternal AI leverages GPU acceleration for fast on-chain computation and inference.

## Data Availability

Eternal AI leverages multiple data availability layers for storage.

## Bitcoin

As a Bitcoin L2, the Eternal AI blockchain rolls up onto Bitcoin and is backed by Bitcoin's security.
