# Base layer: Bitcoin vs Bittensor

The base layer of the Eternal AI architecture is Bitcoin. Eternal AI does not implement its own consensus. It leverages Bitcoinâ€™s security entirely.

## Proof of Work

Bittensor uses a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism for its blockchain. Currently, the only authorized entity to validate transactions is the Opentensor Foundation.

Bitcoin is widely regarded as the most secure blockchain due to its resilience against external interference.

## BitAI Virtual Machine

Eternal AI added a built-in Turing-complete virtual machine to Bitcoin. BitAI enables the creation of Eternals, fully onchain AIs on Bitcoin, as well as the creation of AI-specific Bitcoin L2s.
