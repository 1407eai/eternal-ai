# What are AI chains?

While we can deploy Eternals on any existing blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and they work well, these blockchains are general-purpose and not optimized for AI. AI chains are AI-specific blockchains. They are designed explicitly tailored for onchain AI use cases.

Bittensor has often been hailed as a radical development in building AI-specific blockchains, known as Bittensor subnets. However, the Bittensor protocol still has a few critical choke points or centralized components, such as using Proof of Authority, the five largest validators controlling more than 60% of token supply, and the lack of smart contracts.

Eternal AI intends to create an alternative protocol for building AI-specific blockchains, providing a different set of tradeoffs emphasizing decentralization, scalability, and programmability.

Here are some of the AI chains that you can use today.
