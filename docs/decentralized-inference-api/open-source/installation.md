# Installation

## Prerequisites

In the source code, we tested with _**Python 3.10.0**_, but it should work with any version of Python 3.10.x or higher.

## Installation

Set up the project environment using one of the methods below: **Conda** or **pip**.

### Using Conda

#### **Create a Conda Environment**

```bash
conda create -n eternalai_agents python=3.10.0

```

#### **Activate the Conda Environment:**
